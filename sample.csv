Included is a lengthy chapter on Adolf Hitler's health problems, with a resulting (and surprising) diagnosis of advanced Parkinson's disease. More important than the text, which needs more editing and some scholarly documentation, are the photographs, many showing personal artifacts of the Nazi leaders.

Hitler had parkinsonism, Lattimer posits, probably the ""faster moving post-encephalitic"" sort, and he cites reports of Hitler\'s tremors, first in the left hand, then spreading to other limbs; his well-documented attacks of rage; and the discontinuation of his ""powerful public appearances"" after 1940 as chief among many clues supporting his thesis. As for the fuhrer\'s sidekicks, Lattimer reveals how Goring\'s tailors coped with his ponderous and fluctuating physique and presents photographic evidence of his daughter Edda trying to avoid the fuhrer\'s attentions. Jodl, Keitel, the insufferable Ribbentrop, Speer, and Streicher all receive Lattimer\'s scrutiny, but there are no chapters on Himmler and Goebbels, who both cheated justice--and this book based on discoveries of the Nuremberg trials--by committing suicide before they could be tried.

Jim Gavin, a writer for the <i>New Yorker</i>, has trained his keen eye on the awkward and sobering stages of manhood: the yearning in-between stages; the striving but not-quite-there stages; those aching periods of want. Yet theres a touching lack of the pathetic in the aspirations of these characters: the self-denying basketball player, the unemployed screenwriter, the widowed plumber. In fact, I found it fascinating to recognize my sons, my father, and my brother in these pages (and, yes, myself). Gavins men in the middle may be lazy or nave, they may be underemployed or a bit lost, but theyre also hopers and dreamers, seeking better, brighter days amid the hazy Southern California warmth. --<i>Neal Thompson</i>', 'Reading Gavins first story collection is like listening to a bunch of guys swapping stories in a bar. The storytellers take hard looks at themselves, softened by a small gloss of nostalgia for better times and brighter dreams. Although Gavins characters seem quite similar, the stories they tell, of men searching for ways to bridge where they are and where they want to be, are distinctive and powerful. These middle men, all living in California, as evidenced by the recurrent appearance of Del Taco, know what it means to see the goal and know that it cant be reached. Gavin plumbs the hearts and minds of his men with laserlike accuracy, but he also brings surprising humor to the stories, especially in the relief that his characters often feel when they realize that they wont be able to live up to their own expectations. --Bridget Thoreson', '', '']",Middle Men: Stories,[],"1,505,216 in Books (","['1514356155', '1501174479', '0812988639', 'B07HFYZY7D', '0947993800', '0062450522', '0812997417']",$14.94,1451649312,78

Because of an uncharacteristic alcoholic blackout, he must piece together an alibi for the previous evening. An arrest by Riverton\'s newly appointed police chief, Abby Hooper, seems imminent, as the physical evidence increasingly points to Keegan. Young Hooper is in a tight spot herself: Keegan\'s the man she beat out for the police chief job. But shocking clues as to the identity of ""Jane Doe"" surface in the nick of time, after a prominent citizen commits suicide. Kaiser (Payback) skillfully unfolds his complex story line as Keegan and Hooper join forces in a foray into the treacherous underworld of child prostitution. Complicating matters further, the pair must grapple with their intense mutual attraction (despite a formidable age difference and Keegan\'s past love affair with Hooper\'s estranged mother).
