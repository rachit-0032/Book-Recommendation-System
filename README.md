# Book-Recommendation-System
Analytics Edge Project

In this digital era, most industries have seen a major shift towards using digital platforms to push their offerings, with a sharp rise in user traction during the COVID-19 pandemic. User experience is key on such platforms and a smart equivalent of a traditional salesperson becomes increasingly essential. This is where recommendation systems come into the picture. They understand user behavior and their requirements to recommend them the offerings/products that are most relevant to them, and hence are most likely to buy. Some of the major e-commerce players in the industry, like Amazon, have figured out how to create the best recommendation system, that keeps improving with time, owing to increased information availability for each user. The purpose of this project is to explore recommendation methods on a specific application, that can be easily extended to any domain, displaying the power and relative ease of implementation of such methods.
